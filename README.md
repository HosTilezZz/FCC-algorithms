# FCC's algorithms solutions
all my solutions are available here, some challenges have two solutions, an old one and a new one, the "old solutions" were my first attempt trying to solve the challenges, it was also my first attempt to write algorithms in general, after finishing most of the challenges, i decided to redo the challenges using different approaches, these second attempts are the "new solutions".

challenges can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
